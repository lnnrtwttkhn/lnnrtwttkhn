### Hi there 👋

I am a Postdoctoral Reseach Fellow in the [Max Planck Research Group NeuroCode](https://schucklab.gitlab.io/), led by Nico Schuck, at the [Max Planck Institute for Human Development](https://www.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/en) in Berlin, Germany 👨‍🔬
I study fast reactivation of task representations (known as "replay") in the human brain using fMRI 🧠
I am passionate about open science, computational reproducibility, coding and research data management.
