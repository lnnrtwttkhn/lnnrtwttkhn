### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I am a **Postdoctoral Research Data Scientist** in the [Research Group "Cognitive Neuroscience: Mechanisms of Learning and Change"](https://www.psy.uni-hamburg.de/en/arbeitsbereiche/kognitive-neurowissenschaften-insb-lern-und-veraenderungsmechanismen.html) at the [University of Hamburg](https://www.uni-hamburg.de/en.html), an **Associate Researcher** at the [Max Planck Institute for Human Development](https://www.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/en), Berlin and an **Honorary Fellow** of the [Max Planck UCL Centre for Computational Psychiatry and Ageing Research](https://www.mps-ucl-centre.mpg.de/).
In my scientific work I investigate **fast neural reactivation of task representations** in the human brain using functional magnetic resonance imaging.
I am also passionate about **computational reproducibility**, **research data management**, **open science** and tools that improve the scientific workflow.
